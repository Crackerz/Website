							Ello M8! I'm Will. I live to code, it is what I dream of at night and day dream of when I'm not at the keyboard. If I'm not in terminal, I'm not happy. I love what I do, and I love empowering other people to experience the same excitement I do. All of the "non-coding" things I do are directly coorelated with increasing the amount of time I can code in the future. With that in mind, I would like to think that I'm involved with some pretty cool stuff. I'm going to try and use this website to showcase that. So now lets set some expectations. What can you expect to find here? Organizations I'm involved with (and I encourage you to be too!), coding projects I'm particularly proud of, and highlights of my career. Take a look around! I would love to hear from you, my contact information is at the top of the page.
							<br><br>
							Cheers and Happy Coding!

						<div class="aboutMeText">Founder of OpenSpace, I am working with a group of motivated and talented people to establish a hackerspace in the Southern Illinois Area. We are currently setting up shop in Murphysboro Illinois on the same lot as Carruthers Grade School. In the spirit of Hacker Dojo and CrashSpace, we would like to offer an awesome venue where cool people can do cool things. The idea is to offer a social environment where people of all ages can come to network and improve their technical prowess. It is Wonka's Chocholate Factory for Coders. A wonderland of technology and talent. There is a lot of interest in the community for what we are trying to do, and amazing things are on the horizon. To learn more about our vision, you can join our Facebook Group!<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenSpaceSI">https://www.facebook.com/OpenSpaceSI</a></div>

						<div class="aboutMeText">I'm involved in an organization known as the Saint Louis Area Undergraduate Research Symposium. We are part of a larger organization known as the American Undergraduate Research Society, who's goal is to organize high quality local research symposiums. These symposiums are organized by students for students. Undergraduate research is a relatively new idea in academia, and I believe it has real potential to change the landscape of research. Getting students involved with research early in their career prepares them for what is to come. It is an investment in our future. This belief drives my involvment in STLAURS, the belief that students should be exposed to all aspects of research early and often. In that spirit, we offer students exposure to what takes place "behind the schenes" in organizing a research symposium. By hosting an entirely student run symposium, students see first hand the complexities of bringing academics together. To learn more about our organization, check out our website!<br><br><a href="http://www.stlaurs.com">stlaurs.com</a></div>

								Coding is my life. For reasons I can't explain, people have started paying me to do this. But I'm getting ahead of myself, lets go back to where it all started. I started tinkering with code before I even knew how to run it. I found a book on an old version of DOS when I was in elementary school and started filling notebooks with DOS games written by hand. These applications would never be run on a computer, but I learned a lot about the basic constructs of programming languages like if-statements and for-loops this way. Fast forward to highschool, I got scored a job as a computer tech repairing stuff at a local PC Shop called PC Doctors. I did this for about a year in a half before I spun off Will's Computer Repair, targeting small businesses in the Springfield Illinois area. This was fun, I enjoyed it, but I felt like I was missing something so I packed up and moved to Saint Louis. Here I landed a job working in Geek Squad at Best Buy. 8 months came and went (along with a lot of recognition, apparently I'm a great salesman with "people skills", who knew?) and I decided retail wasn't for me. I applied to SIUC, got accepted and off to college I went. Got picked up by Boeing my freshman year where they let me play with a windtunnel of all things (a massive, foot ball field sized, trans-sonic windtunnel). I wrote code that did cool math stuff to the data collected from it. Still the best summer of my life. Went back to Boeing at the end of my Sophomore year were I learned some cool project management skills (and decided I would stick with the technical side of things). Now here I am, a Junior pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, looking forward to the future. If you are interested in learning a little more, my resume is at the bottom of the page here or you can hop over to the "careers" tab for a little less formal view of the places I've been payed to play in.
